Inside of the virtual machine that was created, open osTicket and login with the previously used account. Then click on the Admin Panel at the top right corner and it should say 'Agent Panel', to show you have Admin authorization to allow editing of the different permissions that we need to arrange. The attached link will show you which settings to change and how to properly set up a basic osTicket use case for a company. https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QH7yrsaiUfYNOgZK7KgTSZQSJ-HYTSVcGFildWMRig/edit#

After adding users and agents and assigning them into departments and teams and configuring the various settings, we will add the last section in the document which is the Help topics. This section is very helpful for help desk employees to get information to help them solve a ticket issue and meet their SLA.
